RVU Counter v1.7 - Legacy Files Cleanup
================================================================================

The Install_or_Upgrade_RVU_Counter.bat script now automatically removes
legacy files during the upgrade process.

================================================================================
FILES REMOVED DURING UPGRADE
================================================================================

✅ Legacy Executables:
   • RVU Counter 1.6.exe
   • RVU Counter 1.51.exe
   • Old backup executables (keeps only the most recent .old file)

✅ Legacy Configuration:
   • rvu_settings.yaml
     → Replaced by: settings/user_settings.yaml + settings/rvu_rules.yaml

✅ Legacy Standalone Tools:
   • fix_database.py
     → Now integrated: Tools Window → Database Repair tab
   
   • check_rvu_excel_files.py
     → Now integrated: Tools Window → Excel Checker tab

================================================================================
WHY THESE ARE REMOVED
================================================================================

1. **rvu_settings.yaml**
   - v1.7 uses split configuration for better maintainability
   - User preferences and RVU rules are now separate
   - Enables rule hotfixes without touching user settings

2. **fix_database.py**
   - Functionality now built into main app
   - Access via wrench icon (🔧) in top-right corner
   - Full UI with dark mode support

3. **check_rvu_excel_files.py**
   - Functionality now built into main app
   - Access via Tools Window → Excel Checker tab
   - Better integration with app settings

4. **Old executables**
   - Prevents confusion about which version to run
   - Keeps folder clean
   - One backup (.old) is kept for emergency rollback

================================================================================
FILES THAT ARE PRESERVED
================================================================================

✅ User Data (Always Preserved):
   • rvu_records.db → Moved to data/rvu_records.db
   • All recorded studies and shifts
   • All historical data

✅ User Settings (Preserved if exist):
   • settings/user_settings.yaml
   • Your preferences, rates, and configurations

✅ Backups Created:
   • backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/ folder with:
     - rvu_records.db.backup
     - rvu_settings.yaml.backup (if it existed)
     - user_settings.yaml.backup (if it existed)
     - rvu_rules.yaml.backup (if it existed)

================================================================================
MANUAL CLEANUP (If Needed)
================================================================================

The batch script handles all necessary cleanup. However, if you have other
custom files you no longer need, you can manually delete:

🔹 Old backup folders (backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/)
   - Safe to delete after confirming v1.7 works correctly
   - Keep at least one recent backup for safety

🔹 Old log files (if any exist in root)
   - v1.7 stores logs in logs/ folder
   - Any .log files in root can be deleted

🔹 Custom scripts you created
   - Any personal automation scripts
   - Only delete if you're sure they're no longer needed

================================================================================
FRESH INSTALL (No Cleanup Needed)
================================================================================

Fresh installations don't have legacy files, so the cleanup steps are skipped.
Only the folder structure is created:

   RVU Counter/
   ├── RVU Counter.exe
   ├── data/              (empty, database created on first run)
   ├── settings/          (created with default templates)
   ├── logs/              (empty)
   ├── helpers/           (empty, populated by app if needed)
   └── documentation/     (empty, populated by app if needed)

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

✅ Automatic cleanup keeps your folder clean
✅ All user data and settings are preserved
✅ Backups are created before any changes
✅ Legacy standalone tools no longer needed (integrated into app)
✅ One-click upgrade experience

If you encounter any issues during upgrade:
1. Check the backup folder for your data
2. Review logs in logs/ folder
3. Ensure all instances of RVU Counter are closed before upgrading
