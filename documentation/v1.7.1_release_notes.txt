RVU Counter v1.7.1 - Auto-Update Test Release
==============================================

This is a test release to validate the auto-update mechanism.

Changes in v1.7.1:
- Fixed pace car Goal mode to use elapsed time from actual shift start
- Fixed pace car Best/Prior modes to intelligently switch between:
  * Time-of-day comparison (if shift starts within 30 min of typical 11pm)
  * Elapsed time comparison (if shift starts >30 min from typical)

Users running v1.7 should see an update notification and be able to upgrade automatically.
